## 📝 Writing Effective Prompts

The key to getting the best results from AI coding assistants lies in how you formulate your prompts.

### ✨ Best Practices

1. **Be Specific and Clear**

   ```markdown
   ✅ "Create a TypeScript function that validates email addresses with RFC 5322 standards"
   ❌ "Make an email validator"
   ```

2. **Provide Context**

   ```markdown
   ✅ "This is a Next.js 13 project using App Router. Create a loading.tsx component that shows a skeleton UI"
   ❌ "Make a loading component"
   ```

3. **Include Requirements**

   ```markdown
   ✅ "The function should:
       - Handle null/undefined inputs
       - Throw custom error messages
       - Be unit tested
       - Use TypeScript strict mode"
   ```

4. **Specify Constraints**

   ```markdown
   ✅ "Optimize this sort function for:
       - Memory efficiency
       - Arrays < 1000 elements
       - Numbers only
       - No external libraries"
   ```

### 🎯 Example Prompts by Task

#### 1. Code Generation

```markdown
✅ "Create a React custom hook for handling form validation with:
    - Email, password, and phone number fields
    - Real-time validation
    - Error message handling
    - TypeScript types
    - Usage example"
```

#### 2. Code Refactoring

```markdown
✅ "Refactor this function to:
    - Use modern ES6+ features
    - Improve error handling
    - Add type safety
    - Enhance performance
    - Include comments explaining changes"
```

#### 3. Bug Fixing

```markdown
✅ "Debug this authentication flow:
    - Check for token expiration
    - Validate refresh token
    - Handle network errors
    - Add logging for issues"
```

    Requirements:
    - Sortable columns
    - Pagination
    - Row selection
    - Custom cell rendering
    
    Technical Context:
    - TypeScript strict mode
    - Styled with TailwindCSS
    - Uses React Query for data fetching
    - Supports SSR"
```

### 2. API Integration

```markdown
✅ "Add an API endpoint that:
    Context:
    - Uses our Express.js backend
    - Follows our REST API conventions
    - Uses our error handling middleware
    
    Requirements:
    - JWT authentication
    - Rate limiting
    - Request validation
    - Response caching
    
    Technical Context:
    - TypeScript
    - MongoDB with Mongoose
    - Express.js middleware pattern
    - OpenAPI documentation"
```

### 3. State Management

```markdown
✅ "Implement global state for:
    Context:
    - Uses Redux Toolkit
    - Follows our store structure
    - Integrates with existing slices
    
    Requirements:
    - User preferences
    - Theme settings
    - Language selection
    
    Technical Context:
    - TypeScript
    - Redux Toolkit Query
    - Persisted state
    - Dev tools support"
```
