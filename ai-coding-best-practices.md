## 📝 Writing Effective Prompts

The key to getting the best results from AI coding assistants lies in how you formulate your prompts.

### ✨ Best Practices

1. **Be Specific and Clear**
   ```markdown
   ✅ "Create a TypeScript function that validates email addresses with RFC 5322 standards"
   ❌ "Make an email validator"
   ```

2. **Provide Context**
   ```markdown
   ✅ "This is a Next.js 13 project using App Router. Create a loading.tsx component that shows a skeleton UI"
   ❌ "Make a loading component"
   ```

3. **Include Requirements**
   ```markdown
   ✅ "The function should:
       - Handle null/undefined inputs
       - Throw custom error messages
       - Be unit tested
       - Use TypeScript strict mode"
   ```

4. **Specify Constraints**
   ```markdown
   ✅ "Optimize this sort function for:
       - Memory efficiency
       - Arrays < 1000 elements
       - Numbers only
       - No external libraries"
   ```

### 🎯 Example Prompts by Task

#### 1. Code Generation
```markdown
✅ "Create a React custom hook for handling form validation with:
    - Email, password, and phone number fields
    - Real-time validation
    - Error message handling
    - TypeScript types
    - Usage example"
```

#### 2. Code Refactoring
```markdown
✅ "Refactor this function to:
    - Use modern ES6+ features
    - Improve error handling
    - Add type safety
    - Enhance performance
    - Include comments explaining changes"
```

#### 3. Bug Fixing
```markdown
✅ "Debug this authentication flow:
    - Check for token expiration
    - Validate refresh token
    - Handle network errors
    - Add logging for issues"
```

## 💡 Best Working Practices

### 1. Iterative Development

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Basic Prompt] --> B[Review Output]
    B --> C[Refine Prompt]
    C --> D[Improve Result]
    D --> B
```

1. Start Simple
   - Begin with core functionality
   - Add features incrementally
   - Build on working code

2. Review & Refine
   - Check generated code
   - Test edge cases
   - Improve gradually

### 2. Code Quality Control

#### Always Verify:
- ✅ Code functionality
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Edge cases
- ✅ Performance
- ✅ Security implications

#### Security Checklist:
- 🔒 No hardcoded credentials
- 🔒 Input validation
- 🔒 Secure dependencies
- 🔒 Error message safety
- 🔒 Access control

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Do's and Don'ts

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
|-------|----------|
| Specify programming language | Assume AI knows context |
| Include version requirements | Skip error handling |
| Mention framework constraints | Accept code without review |
| Ask for examples | Share sensitive data |
| Request explanations | Use vague descriptions |

### Common Patterns

#### 1. Documentation Requests
```markdown
"Document this function including:
- Purpose
- Parameters
- Return values
- Examples
- Error cases"
```

#### 2. Testing Requests
```markdown
"Generate unit tests for this function covering:
- Happy path
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios
- Input validation"
```

#### 3. Performance Optimization
```markdown
"Optimize this code for:
- Time complexity
- Memory usage
- Resource efficiency
- Scalability"
```
