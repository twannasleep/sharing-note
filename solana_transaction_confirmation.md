# Solana Transaction Confirmation & Expiration

## Overview

Solana transactions use a unique mechanism for confirmation that relies on blockhashes acting as timestamps. Understanding this system is crucial for developers to build reliable applications.

## Transaction Basics

A Solana transaction consists of:
- A **header** with metadata
- A **list of instructions** to execute
- A **list of accounts** to load
- A **recent blockhash** (crucial for expiration)

## Transaction Lifecycle

1. Transaction creation (instructions + accounts)
2. Fetch recent blockhash
3. Simulate transaction
4. User signs transaction 
5. Send to RPC node for forwarding to block producer
6. Block producer validation and inclusion
7. Confirmation or expiration detection

        T2 --- T151
    end
```

## Blockhash Expiration System

- Each transaction includes a "recent blockhash" that acts as a timestamp
- Validators maintain a `BlockhashQueue` of the 300 most recent blockhashes
- Transactions are only processed if their blockhash is among the 151 most recent ones
- With slots lasting ~400-600ms, transactions expire in approximately 60-90 seconds

## Why Transactions Expire

Expiration prevents double-processing without maintaining per-account nonces:

**Advantages:**
- Multiple concurrent transactions from one account
- Clear success/failure/expiration states
- No "stuck" pending transactions

**Disadvantages:**
- Validators must track processed transaction IDs
- Short expiration window (approximately 60-90 seconds)

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate commitment level** when fetching blockhashes:
   - `confirmed` is recommended (balance of recency and stability)
   - `processed` gives most time but risks using dropped fork blockhashes
   - `finalized` is safest but reduces effective expiration time

```mermaid

    subgraph "Commitment Levels"
        direction TB
        P["processed<br/>(most recent)"] --> C["confirmed<br/>(RECOMMENDED)"] --> F["finalized<br/>(most stable)"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Trade-offs"
        direction TB
        T1["More Time Before<br/>Expiration"] --> T2["Balance of Time<br/>and Stability"] --> T3["Less Risk of<br/>Fork Drops"]
        R1["~5% Risk of<br/>Fork Drops"] --> R2["Very Low Risk of<br/>Fork Drops"] --> R3["No Risk of<br/>Fork Drops"]
    end
    
    P --> T1
    P --> R1
    C --> T2
    C --> R2
    F --> T3
    F --> R3
```

2. **Match preflight commitment level** with the level used to fetch blockhash

3. **Be cautious with RPC nodes** that may lag behind the network

4. **Avoid reusing stale blockhashes** - fetch new ones frequently

5. **Use healthy RPC nodes** to get the most recent blockhashes

6. **Wait sufficiently for expiration** before retry attempts

7. **Consider durable transactions** for use cases with challenging confirmation requirements

## For Difficult Cases: Durable Transactions

For situations where expiration is problematic:
- Create a special on-chain "nonce" account
- Transaction must start with an "advance nonce" instruction
- Transaction uses the stored "durable blockhash"
- Never expires until processed
